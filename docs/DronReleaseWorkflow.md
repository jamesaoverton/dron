# Dron Release Workflow

To create a new Dron release:

1. [Update the external components](UpdateComponents.md)
2. Build the release files
3. Create a GitHub release

## Update the external components
The Dron Builder code is currently still bundled in a Scala module managed by Matt McConnell. 
Please refer to the detailed documentation for [updating the external components](UpdateComponents.md).
