# Workflows

To ensure that the the ontology confirms to the highest level of OBO standards, we developed a few informal workflows that resemble software development workflows, build on well known technologies and principles such as version control, continuous integration and dependency management.

There are four main workflows:
1. The [Editors Workflow](EditorsWorkflow.md) describes how you make a change to the ontology.
2. The [Release Workflow](ReleaseWorkflow.md) describes how you create a new ontology release.
3. The [Update Imports Workflow](UpdateImports.md) describes how you can refresh an import, for example to import a new term, or to refresh the import to a newer version.
4. The [Upgrading the ODK repo and adding imports](RepoManagement.md) describes how you can change an existing import and upgrade to a newer version of the ODK.
